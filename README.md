----------------

An implementation of communal web-page using github repository, a github page of the project, few bash scripts and a makefile.

I'm currently it to publish computer science collage notes. It consists of pages, that get generated by parsing markdown files and adding a universal header to them. Each page has its own directory, with a main markdown file called text.md. The header contains a link to main page (which contains a list of links to all the subpages) and a link to the markdown file on the github, so anyone with a github account can edit the file.  

Pages get generated automatically by running make command. To create a new subpage, you can run a create-course \<name\> bash script in scripts directory. It will automatically create a new directory, a markdown file in it and it will add a new entrie to the makefile. Makefile only needs to be edited if we add any subpages to the subpage itself.

Templates directory contains file called 'head', that defines few css properties and gets added to all the pages, and a file called 'index' that contains a content for the main page (the links to the subpages get generated automatically).

In scripts directory there is also a pre-commit hook, that you can link to .git/hooks directory if you want git to check if the site is up to date before a commit. If it finds its not, then it runs make, prints a message and aborts a commit.
