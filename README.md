----------------

An implementation of communal web-page using github repository, a github page of the project, few bash scripts and a makefile.

I'm currently using it to publish notes from computer science classes. It consists of pages that get generated by parsing markdown files and adding a universal header to them. Each page has its own directory, with a main markdown file called `text.md`. The header contains a link to main page (which contains a list of links to all the subpages) and a link to the markdown file on the github, so anyone with a github account can edit the file.  

To update the html pages run `make` command in projects root. To create new subpage, run `create-course \<name\>` bash script in `scripts` directory. It will create a new directory containing a markdown file and it will add a new rule to the `makefile`. Makefile only needs to be edited if we add any subpages to the subpage itself.

Templates directory contains file called `head`, that defines few css properties, and gets added to all the pages. It also contains a file called `index`, that contains a content for the main page (the links to the subpages get generated automatically).

In `scripts` directory there is also a `pre-commit` hook that can be linked to `.git/hooks` directory, in order for git to check if the site is up to date before a commit. If it's not, then it runs make and aborts a commit.
