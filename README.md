----------------

An implementation of communal web-page using github repository, a github page of the project, few bash scripts and a makefile.

I'm cruelty using it to publish computer science collage notes. It consists of pages, that get generated by parsing markdown files and adding a universal header to them. Each page has its own folder, with a main markdown file called text.md. The header contains a link to main page, which is basically just a list of links to the subpages and a link to the markdown file on the github, so anyone with a github account can edit file and automatically send a pull request.  

The html pages get generated automatically by running make command. To create new subpage, you can just run a create-course <name> bash script in scripts folder. It will automatically create a new directory, a markdown file and it will add an entire to the makefile. Only time a makefile needs to be edited is if we add any subpages to the subpage itself.

In templates folder is stored a head file, that defines a css properties and gets added to all the pages, and a index file that contains a content for the main page (the links to the subpages get generated automatically).

In scripts folder there is also a pre-commit hook, that you can link to .git/hooks directory if you want git to check if the site is up to date before a commit. If it finds its not, then it runs make, prints a message and aborts a commit.
